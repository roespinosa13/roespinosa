<p>Whether in the world of numerology or mathematics, numbers have played a significant role throughout the history of human civilization. Surely you have heard of 3.1415 and its infinite digits, the bad luck superstition that surrounds the number 13 (I am opposed to this belief), 5 and its cosmological value, and dates like the 4th of July and 9-11 are iconic in American culture. In sports the number 23 is synonymous with Michael Jordan, while 10 is always associated with footballers Pele and Diego Maradona. 2000 marked a new millennium, while 2012 was full of expectation, both years were believed by some to bring the world to an end. Numbers are those magical symbols that are a ubiquitous in language and necessary for everyone around the globe. </p>

<p>For Mexico we remember certain numbers in dates such as September 15, 1810, 1910, year 68, year 85 when the big earthquake occurred, etc. Over the past two months the number <b>43</b> has taken over the national media in Mexico as well as internationally. There isn't a single Mexican that is not aware of this number whether it be through images, news, Internet or just simple word of mouth. The number 43 has become part of the Mexican routine since it entered in the psyche of Mexicans everywhere. </p>

<p>So far the facts are: on September 26th students of the Normal School of Ayotzinapa were stopped and and were fired upon by the municipal police of Iguala, Guerrero during their travels. When the smoke cleared Normalistas and civilians were killed on the scene, while 43 more are still missing.</p>

<p>From there sentiments of confusion and bitterness have spread throughout the Mexican population. Details have been clouded between the cast of twisted characters; Mayor of Iguala and his wife and their ties to organized crime, the Governor of Guerrero, the municipal police, the Mexican army, Priest Solalinde, the media, the self-defense groups and normalistas. The information coming from everywhere has left more questions than answers and has been filled with contradictions, investigations, cover-ups and discoveries, everything making the truth seems increasingly distant and uncertain. The truth is that this is one of the blackest episodes in recent times in our country. </p>

<p>Regardless of someone's stance on political or social issues and without criticizing the opposite train of thought, it's important to take the time to reflect on what happened and ask…</p>

<h3>Where does Mexico stand in the eyes of the world?</h3>

<p>True, we are the country of tequila, party, tacos, beaches and the most warm and friendly people, but what is our current situation on the map? Internationally the media, human rights organizations, citizens and leaders around the world have condemned the Mexican government, due to their inability to handle the a situation like Ayotzinapa. </p>

<p>People from all around the world have now been given a glimpse into the on-going circus that is the Mexican government, leaving many Mexicans embarrassed by their elected officials' conduct. From the scandal of the proposed bullet train from Mexico City to Queretaro or the shady purchase of a house owned by Angélica Rivera, the wife of the Mexican President. Through these situations Mexican Government has been criticized by political pundits and even members of Hollywood, Rob Schneider famously lobbied for a job at Televisa if he could be given the same deal as Rivera. </p>

<p>As more light has been shed on the current President's time in charge, details have emerged of his luxury airfare to his personal make-up artist that travels with him everywhere and has many Mexicans fed up.  Mexican Attorney Murillo Karam made history on Twitter for famously coining the hashtag #YaMeCansé (I’m tired) a term that spent months in the trending topics and even set records within the <i>twittersphere </i>. However like many things that contradict the Mexican government itwas suddenly taken off of social media and out of the minds of the Mexican populous. </p>

<p>The list goes on and on, as more truth is exposed the more Mexicans and the rest of the world look on in disbelief-- the truth appears to be much stranger than fiction.</p>




<h3>Where is the word called Humanism? </h3>

<p>While much of the country is outraged by what happened, there is another sector that seems to have a kind of brain dysfunction. This class complaint if there are peaceful manifestations that generate traffic and inconvenience and their valuable time is affected. They seems indignant if a door has been burned and some glasses are broken (which should <b>NOT</b> happen under any circumstances) and there are further questions about who generate these destructions –if police covered or civilians-. No incensed about violence and insecurity because that happens in another Mexico, a very distant but not in theirs. Justify the abuse because <i>"they were well deserved, asked for it"</i>. Arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force abuses including women and children, all is correct to keep his vague idea of order.</p>

<p>In order to keep Mexico moving forward economically some Mexicans have argued for silence, and have urged others to simply forget the current political situation in Mexico. Clearly these individuals need to look into their hearts and get their priorities straight, they have a double-moral bigger than the Pacific Ocean. When the Uruguayan President Mujica stated that <i>'Life in Mexico is worth less than a dog” </i> it was a tough blow for Mexicans to hear what others thought of our country and the acceptance of violence. Senseless, while intellectuals, artists and humanists around the world express solidarity there is this group who approves the atrocity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>«It is an heretic that makes the fire, Not she which burns in't.»<br>W.Shakespeare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The indifference and intolerance, of those who have lost all touch and any hint of sensitivity. These individuals seem to be afraid of self-reflection and feel vulnerable to any change in routine, their mental models feel attacked when thinking different, they feel invaded by those who seek to change the things for better.</p>
<p>Their maxim is and will be always the same: "stop claiming, get to work and study, change is in oneself". Of course, there is no doubt about that, just that there is a detail that seemed to forget; opportunities are for the privileged minority. The fortunate ones should ensure to help others and combat the selfishness that seems to be at its highest level of expression. </p>
<h3>Light and shadow, eternal contrasts uncovered</h3>
<p>All images of a solid, flawless and fully credible government in Mexico has been completely disarmed. Social Networks, alternative media, independent media, mobile devices, and responsible citizens have allowed the rest of the population to have a clear picture of these shady events in the state of Guerrero that have been controlled by the mainstream media. Still, the promises of punishment against bad guys still remain, just promises, and while the actions to be taken are done with those expressing dissatisfaction. Just watch some approvals on the Law of Mobility (street protests might be illegal), the impediment to create a commission to investigate the Mexican White House and the legal case of Abarca marriage until now remains frozen.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And it is a fact, to enjoy the daylight had to navigate the night slowly and risky, -Phoenician anecdotes-.</p>
<p>All the fear and collective anxiety generated by this situation have unveiled a monument of solidarity from the Mexican society, especially from the young generation. Even the more attached to their solipsism ("only I exist") have realized that there are external factors which affect their lives every day and it's worth taking actions. Those who were once totally indifferent, those who put the headphones and closed their eyes, those who made a "bad vote," those who saw politics and economics as boring subjects, have been infected by something called <i><b> conscientia</b></i>, finally.</p>

<p>It is not very necessary nor pleasant delve into this issue as we have all seen in recent weeks the embarrassing statements by public officials, partisan youth, major media and the Mexican elite, which applauding like seals at the horror. While this solidarity that characterizes us has surfaced likewise makes this class counterparty is unable to see situations from another point of view than the immediate benefit and well paid.</p>

<p>And the opposition? We know that the so-called left and other oppositions are a joke, a business in rent to the boss in turn. They were conspicuous by their absence, these new political parties, "great leaders of change" hidden in the shadows waiting times of elections and allocation of budgets, so they will remember us that there was an incident involving the number 43 and was the fault of the party of the other candidate. Maybe is better not to attack as they all have a tail to step at? All that proclaimed resistance is just another child maintained by the public purse. Probably just as well, since all these claims have no color or institution are mere work of citizens concerned about their country and their loved ones.</p>


<p> The rage and impotence in some make-called spreading to arms. Absurd, -a personal opinion of a server- should be no violence or radicalization and all that always distorts the causes and give reasons for oppression. Furthermore, it is to fight the legendary <i>Hydra of Lerna</i> and by cutting one head may three more will arise. Recall that with power comes corruption in the individual and there is no guarantee that the so-called "liberator" of today will not be the tyrant of tomorrow, especially in the history of our country. The management of frustrated masses is a very dangerous situation, as seen in history such as the 1930's in Germany.</p>

<p>The "chairos" the neo-liberals, right-wing, leftists, anarchists, pacifists, radicals, “mochos”, servile, intellectuals, “agachones”, citizens. <b> #TodosSomosMexicanos</b> And while there are many things that divide us as a society from socio-economic status, religious beliefs, political movements, national origin, age, race, it should not cause any fragmentation as it goes beyond what we perceive in the foreground, is a problem against humanity, respect for life and all those who enjoy a sane one should protect this cause, the cause exist freely.</p>



<h3>The country that wants to remove the blindfold</h3>


<p>This is not about politics, or about attacking an official, a President, a political party, an institution, the media or private companies. It's about deciding what our goals as individuals are, and what are expectations for Mexico are so that we can ensure better living conditions for future generations and stop inheriting bad habits that have been forced on Mexicans for centuries. It's time for Mexican to turn the corner and leave the impunity for corruption and embrace <b>respect</b> and <b>fairness.</b></p>

<p>As other nations around the world have evolved, Mexico seems to remain stagnant and continues to cultivate the same practices, the same mistakes, and putters along in the same vicious cycle it's been in for the past decades. It's time to expect more from our public officials and demand they do the job they were voted to do. With disappointing previous results, it's going to be a long road for political figures to restore the faith of the Mexican voter. Technology, Education and Information are going to continue to be a force in this hard –but not impossible- way of improvement.</p>

<p>It's time we be exemplary citizens. This young generation of Mexicans need to learn to work well and set the example for others. Practice what you preach, every passing minute is the opportunity to turn it all around by taking a stand against corruption, cronyism, and the apathy that exists in out lovely country. Mexicans have the chance to educate others and plant their ideals to their neighbors, an individual decision that might affect positively into groups.</p>

<p>Before wanting to enforce any territorial law must be respected the inalienable rights of man, and the truth is that <b>43 young Mexicans</b>, 43 human-beings with expectations and goals to achieve have not yet come home and that number is unlikely to be forgotten. The blindfold begin to fall in the XXI century Mexico and it is our job keep doing the “heart guts”.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p><br>
